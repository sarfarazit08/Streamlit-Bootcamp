00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,299
today in this course we are going to see

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,400
all about Azure open AI exercises okay

6
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,660
so we are going to perform some of the

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,279
exercises which are on generative AI

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,560
and the offerings on Azure cloud from

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,480
openai all the open AI Services which

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,180
are available on azure

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,640
we are going to do some Hands-On on that

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,820
for that I have also created Azure

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,100
subscription using my account this month

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,739
you can use this email if you have any

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,059
queries to write it for me so let's

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,520
proceed

17
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,219
so in this code first handphone is

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,480
exploring generative AI with being

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,360
copied

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,820
so let's open this in a new tab

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,079
and move to this new tab

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,059
here

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,239
we'll go through this

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,960
whole course for Hands-On write-up given

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,960
here on this page one bye

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,760
so before you start you need a personal

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,400
Microsoft account

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,799
if you do not have one go to sign up

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,140
live.com to sign up and create a

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,340
personal account which I already have

31
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,920
which is surprised it 08

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,240
which I already have so I'll be using

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
this account

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,259
okay

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,420
now open bing.com and sign in with your

36
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,320
personal Microsoft account

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,820
so let me open this in a new tab

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,880
okay

39
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,860
I've opened it and I have also signed in

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,540
using that same account

41
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,360
right

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,460
so that's the first thing I have done

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,380
so I have already signed

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,720
okay

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,140
if you don't know how to sign in

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,140
you will see this type of Icon where if

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,240
you are signed out

48
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,759
you can click on sign in button which

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,680
will be showing here and then give all

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,319
the Account Details like email ID and

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,319
password and sign in using Microsoft

52
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,000
Live account

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,459
okay and for us creating that live

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,660
account we can go to this site and

55
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,000
create one

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,540
now moving

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,580
so once you sign in using your work or

58
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,640
school account you'll see a slightly

59
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,980
different user experience then what I

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,840
see as a personal account so this is my

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,340
personal Microsoft

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,099
black account but you'll see a different

63
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,400
uh UI

64
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,319
so that's for being Enterprise chat okay

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,459
because it's related to your work and

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,220
explore

67
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,780
so it will be an Enterprise check

68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,180
next

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,560
select chat from the menu at the top of

70
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,720
the screen

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,680
chat brings you to bring for pilot okay

72
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,040
let's chat

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,120
and it is taking me to

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,900
this chat interface being chat interview

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,900
next

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,300
what this means is that unlike search

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,040
alone like normally what we do in Google

78
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,800
search or Bing search

79
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,900
we have some search bar we click some

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,959
words here some points here and then

81
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,920
we just hit enter or click on search

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,860
button and we can search that

83
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,220
online using the Bing or Google search

84
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,900
in this or any other searching

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,599
but here

86
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,720
unlike any search engine

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,700
Bing co-pilot can put together new

88
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
responses based on natural language

89
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,540
modeling

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,040
so it works on a NLP or natural language

91
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,879
processing

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,739
which gives responses similar to what a

93
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,019
human

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,280
normally uh

95
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,400
speaks or relation right so that kind of

96
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,480
uh language

97
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,939
these AIS

98
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,139
artificial intelligence built into the

99
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:21,780
Bing browser Bing chat it can provide

100
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:25,500
and it's basically using Bing

101
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,560
is using chat GPT fourth version right

102
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,699
we have other old versions like charity

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,639
3.5 as well

104
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:37,800
but here Bing chat is using chat GPT 4

105
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,780
okay

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,960
now towards the bottom of the screen

107
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,080
you'll see a window ask me anything

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,940
let me keep these steps side by side so

109
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,960
that way we'll be able to see it more

110
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,500
properly

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,560
okay so this is our chat interface and

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,940
here it is saying ask me anything

113
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,300
right

114
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,800
if you enter the prompts into the window

115
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,919
beam copilot uses the entire

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,199
conversation ready to return the sponsor

117
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,320
so let's try one thing

118
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,220
so in the prompt or here in the ask me

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,800
anything

120
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,900
I am going to write this one what are

121
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,940
the three pros and cons of traveling in

122
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:20,340
a winter in the winter

123
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,520
I can also speak using this microphone

124
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,400
or I can type the whole thing here

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,400
let me just speak it in the microphone

126
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,880
I'll allow microphone

127
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,380
what are the three pros and cons of

128
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,840
traveling in the winter

129
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,180
so this is the prompt I have given

130
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,400
searching for pros and cons of traveling

131
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,199
in the winter traveling in Winter has

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,600
its own set of advantages and

133
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,940
disadvantages here are some of the pros

134
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,340
and cons of traveling in Winter Pros

135
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,199
cheaper prices winter is considered

136
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,360
Enough season for travel which means

137
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,400
that many airlines hotels enter

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,160
operators offer discounts to attract

139
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,380
more customers fewer crowds since winter

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,580
is not a popular time to travel there

141
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,919
are fewer tourists at popular

142
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,479
destinations this means that you can

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,820
enjoy the sights and sounds without

144
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,919
having to deal with large crowds winter

145
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,440
sports if you're a fan of winter sports

146
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,780
like skiing snowboarding or ice skating

147
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
then traveling in winter is perfect for

148
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,660
you

149
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,060
many scale Resorts offer great deals

150
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,220
during the winter months cons

151
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,319
bad weather winter weather can be

152
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,600
unpredictable and harsh which can led to

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
flight cancellations delays and other

154
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,340
travel disruptions limited daylight

155
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,139
during the winter months the days are

156
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,900
shorter which means that you have less

157
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,639
time to explore your destination

158
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,259
seasonal closures some attractions and

159
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,819
activities may be closed during the

160
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,600
winter months due to weather conditions

161
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:51,539
or seasonal closures I hope

162
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,060
so once you click to stop the readout

163
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,479
then it will stop in between whatever it

164
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,240

165
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,360
response that you get it's very

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,940

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:18,300
points have subheadings as well right

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,479
but that's what we are going to see as a

172
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,520
chat response now here

173
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,759

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:46,319
or four words right find me three more

181
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:50,699
Pros right but

182
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,160
chat uh this chat interface or chat GPT

183
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,800
already knows about the context in which

184
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,819
I am taught right which is about the

185
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,819
winter

186
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,039
pros and cons winter season or traveling

187
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,039
in the winter season right so that's the

188
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,960
context like what are the pros and cons

189
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,479
of traveling in the winter

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,539
so this is the actual context traveling

191
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,120
in Wind okay and if I'm asking for pros

192
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:18,060
so it is already

193
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
giving me these three pros of

194
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,199
traveling in winter

195
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,259
so it already knows about the conference

196
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,419
now if I'll just write

197
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,240
this one okay

198
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,800
so let me just use my microphone to give

199
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,260
this prompt

200
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,240
what are three places I can go to find

201
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,700
fewer crowds

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,740
searching for places to travel in winter

203
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,860
with fewer crowd

204
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,940
I stopped playing this but I can get the

205
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,160
response still right so readout is

206
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:54,540
stopped but the response is

207
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,620
coming from chat Equity AI so we get

208
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,740
this three uh results a responses about

209
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:06,440
the places where we can travel and we'll

210
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,440
have fewer Cloud crowds okay

211
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Italy Saint Lucia and Mount Fiji or PC

212
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,820
in Japan

213
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,839
all these options we are getting right

214
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:22,500
so notice that the Bingo pilot is able

215
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,140
to give a related response okay

216
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,580
it can drop earlier memories of the

217
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,640
conversation

218
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,320
that's as it continue as a result the

219
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,480
responses you get may not be directly

220
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,000
related to the traveling

221
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,420
this is largely due to the Token input

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,940
limitation when chat remembers earlier

223
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,459
parts of the conversation or the context

224
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,380
of the conversation it is because it has

225
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,580
saved a certain amount of tokens from

226
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,320
the conversation

227
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,899
earlier we gave

228
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,600
this prompt right

229
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:58,800
pros and cons of traveling it already

230
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,800
got the context by that query from that

231
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,360
query yes so it already knows about the

232
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,000
content okay

233
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,019
as new tokens are introduced by your new

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,519
prompt and responses Chat Me Network

235
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:17,220
so as we go further and give some varied

236
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,440
prompts or different prompts which is

237
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,220
different than

238
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,080
this context existing contract then the

239
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,080
older tokens will

240
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:31,080
get removed and newer tokens

241
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,600
based on our neighbor prompts and topics

242
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,200
that we are writing here it will be

243
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,320
saved within chat GPT

244
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,420
so it will remember the new tokens

245
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,820
basically and reply based on the newer

246
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,060
token the new topic button next to the

247
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,800
chat window is useful being co-pilot to

248
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,040
clear the previous conversion so if you

249
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,200
click on the new topic it will omit or

250
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,579
remove all the folder

251
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:02,779
uh tokens basically and it will start a

252
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,779
new topic with a

253
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,200
without any problems

254
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,380
so this will be very new topic now we

255
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,720
can also give prompts like create an

256
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,660
image of an elephant eating a hamburger

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,100
so this will generate

258
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,720
a new

259
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,440
images okay using Dali okay Dali's

260
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,899
generative AI for image generation right

261
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,839
so it will generate images based on the

262
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,899
text prompt that we will give

263
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,519
so let's give this from instead I will

264
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,880
give a different prompt and let's see

265
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,880
what happens

266
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,360
create an image of a dog eating a

267
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,300
hamburger

268
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,160
searching for dog

269
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,160
dog eating hamburger right

270
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,360
so that's my problem and here you can

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,320
see the response which is almost look

272
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,760
like

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,940
uh which is looking very real like a dog

274
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,480
is eating a hamburger right it's

275
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,120
generated by Dali

276
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,040
now if you notice the responses may look

277
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,860
similar but not the same

278
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,320
okay these are looking very similar but

279
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:28,860
all these images are different

280
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:33,000
maybe from side view from

281
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:35,700
top or or front view like that okay

282
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,100
so these are very different

283
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,079
responsive

284
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,540
image responsible

285
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,000
so in the response there is a touch at

286
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,399
the bottom that means powered by darling

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,380
so consider how Dali is based on large

288
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,620
language model as your natural language

289
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,240
input generates image so Dali is nothing

290
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,060
but uh

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,200
image generation AI or artificial

292
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,839
intelligence

293
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,459
which is trained on

294
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,120
so many images

295
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,260
to generate realistic images based on

296
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,240
our text

297
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,579
so whatever the text prompt we are given

298
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,139
like dog eating hamburger

299
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:19,019
it is trying to take that text as tokens

300
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,880
and then based on the tokens trying to

301
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:24,420
identify

302
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,240
context like hamburger

303
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,779
dog and the process is about 80.

304
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,200
or

305
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:36,540
images which are almost similar but not

306
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,139
the same and

307
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,620
considering this talk so a dog eating

308
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,620
handle

309
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,000
now return to bingo pilot chat by

310
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,519
clicking on the Microsoft Bing icon on

311
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,720
the top right corner of the screen

312
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,160
okay

313
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:59,220
baby click on this so this opens up the

314
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,959
small side window right now let's see an

315
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,200
example of fourth generation and

316
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:08,540
translate type in a prompt use

317
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,540
python to create a list okay

318
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,779
just give this problem

319
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,320
and paste it here

320
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,839
and submit it

321
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,839
use Python to create a list

322
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:27,779
and here you can see some examples

323
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,680
related to python code where it's trying

324
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,500
to

325
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,620
create an empty list

326
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,980
and then it's time to add

327
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:40,440
three numbers one two and three within

328
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,019
that list and then here we can see the

329
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,639
output if we print the list

330
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,839
okay

331
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,420
so

332
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,139
there is a shortcut way like that my

333
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,139
list equal to

334
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,160
within this Square braces you put all

335
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,880
the list items like one two and three

336
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,420
numbers so this is how chat repeat is

337
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,360
also able to give us python codes right

338
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,740
now type in the prompt translate that

339
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,839
into shisha

340
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,440
so the current Port that we have in the

341
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,300
python we want it to be converted to a C

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,199
sharp based port

343
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,600
so we'll just click or give the prompt

344
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,820
translate that into C sharp

345
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,839
okay

346
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,240
and then that code will be translated

347
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,240
into a C sharp based coding where we are

348
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,360
creating a new list which is following a

349
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,800
C sharp syntax right then we are adding

350
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,380
three

351
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,360
numbers one two and three and then we

352
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,500
are using console.writeline

353
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,300
to print that list of items okay one by

354
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,120
one using four original

355
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,760
okay and you're creating over the

356
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,600
list items okay

357
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,820
so this is the result or we can create

358
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
a new list by hardboarding the values

359
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,480
like one to n directly

360
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,779
okay

361
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,880
so both ways we can create

362
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,560
a list

363
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,260
now

364
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,839
here is a bonus form what are the three

365
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,279
examples of generative AI helping people

366
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,740
okay

367
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,600
so let's do that

368
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,600
we'll copy this

369
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:30,540
okay and let's put here in this chat

370
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,620
window I'll close this you can always

371
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,420
call this chat window from here or you

372
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,740
can go to

373
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:42,360
this vendor and then you can put your

374
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,279
prompt here

375
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,699
let me submit this

376
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:50,040
so these are the examples of

377
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:53,040
generative AI helping people like

378
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,839
healthcare accessibility product

379
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,839
development

380
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,180
boarding that would be more

381
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,799
we ask only three so it's giving three

382
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:08,280
responses so that's about

383
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,260
